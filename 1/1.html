        <p>If you will be joining 42SV soon-ish, then this article might be for you.</p>
        <br>

        <p>First of all, if you got your acceptance letter, I would like to personally congratulate you. Welcome to 42. However, it’s just the beginning of a long journey for you. In this article, I would like to share a few tips with you that can help you a lot as a Cadet.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Life as a Cadet</h2>

        <p>Life as a cadet is nothing compared to the piscine. It’s not as intense and fast paced as the piscine. There are a few requirements for Cadets living in dorm (this does not apply to people not living in dorms). If you are in dorms, you have to level up once a month, you have to spend at least 36 hrs at the lab and you have to take 2 exams per month. That’s the minimum you have to do to keep your dorm. If you fail any of the requirements, you will be subscribed to “Check your dorms”. You’ll have to explain why you failed to meet the requirements and you might risk eviction from the dorms. </p>

        <h2>The problem that most Cadets face at 42</h2>

        <p>When you first join as a Cadet, you are super motivated. You spend between 60 to 80 hrs per week coding at the lab. You knock out the first 2 projects within a month. And then you start chilling. You lose your motivation and you start slacking off. You start thinking you have no life, you do nothing else but code and all your motivation goes straight out of the window. Next thing you know you are registered to Check Your Dorms and you risk eviction. </p>

        <h2>How to stay motivated while at 42?</h2>
        <p>First of all, you need a gameplan. Before, you start the program, take a day to plan what you want to achieve by joining 42. You came to 42 with a purpose. For most of us, it’s to learn to code, get a 6 figure job and change our lives. You need to constantly remind yourself of that. </p>
        
        <br><br>

        <p>It would help you to write that down on a piece of paper and to stick that to the wall next to you bed. That way when you wake up every morning, that’s the first thing you see. </p>

        <br><br>
        
        <p>Another thing that would help you is a clear plan of what path you are trying to go and you need to set goals to achieve them. The system at 42 teaches you how to code. It does not make you job ready. You have to work on that on your own. The easiest way for you to get out there and get a job is by learning web development. </p>
