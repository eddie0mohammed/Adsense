        <h2>Phase 4: Learning a Framework</h2>

        <p>Learning a framework will increase you chances of getting a job.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why not learn a Framework during phase 1: </h3>
        <p>You might think it would have been a good idea but it's not. You need have solid fundamentals and know how to build anything without a framework first.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Having weak fundamentals will only affect you career as a developer. That's why you should learn the old way of doing things first. Also, keep in mind, when you apply for a job, most of the time, the interviewer will question you on the fundamentals first. So, it's always good to have solid fundamentals.</p>
        <p></p>
        <br><br>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> While you start learning a framework, you should continue with the following in parallel:</p>
        <div class="list_container">
            <ul>
                <li><p>Continue making money on the side</p> </li>
                <li><p>Continue learning data structures and algorithms (30 mins a day)</p> </li>
                <li><p>Continue solving 1 coding challenges; 1 a day</p></li>
                
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> In case you forgot some of the items mentionned in the list, don't worry. It’s normal. It’s impossible to retain everything. Instead, you should focus more on learning on the fly as needed.</p>

        <h3>Important:  Keep solving 1 js coding challenge a day.</h3>
        <br><br>

        <h2>Phase 3</h2>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The items mentionned in Phase 3 should be learnt in parallel with earning money as a Frontend Developer.</p>
        <br>


        <h3>1. Go deeper with CSS and JS (2 weeks)</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>Relearn Flexbox and Grid</p>
            <p>Start learning about css animations (keyframes). Practice.</p>
            <p>Build a couple of projects (simple js components, tooltips, todolist, sliding navbar, ...)</p>
   
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <h3>2. Learn about basics of CSS design patterns: duration 3 days</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>Start with BEM. there are more design patterns but you will learn it as needed.</p>
            <p>Starts using bem style of writing css. You’ll feel like a premium developer.</p>
   
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <h3>3. Learn the basics of Javascript design patterns.  (duration 5 days)</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>Focus on the basics. (singleton, module, revealing module, ...) :</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will forget most of these. However, it will be easier to re-learn them on the fly as needed. (Design patterns depend on what you are trying to build)</p>
   
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <h3>4. Study Data structures and Algorithms.</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>This will make you become a better developer. </p>
            <p>Spend 1 hour a day for a period of 1 week. After that stick to 30 mins a day.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep learning Data Structures and Algorithms</p>
            <p>Apply them to your coding problems.</p>
   
        </div>

        <br><br>
        <h3>You are now a Pro</h3>
        <br>
