        <h2>What is phase 2?</h2>
        <p>During phase 2, you will be learning new technologies that you’ll be adding to your stack, which will help you get better as a developer and make you more productive</p>
        <br><br>


        <h3>1. Learn Sass: (duration 1 week) : Learn</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>Sass - Css extension: (pre-processor) gives you more power, allows you to write modular css.</p>
            <p>Spend 1 week on it and then go back to javascript. If ever you need it in the future, you’ll be able to pick it up easily.</p>
   
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <h3>2. jQuery: (duration: 1 week): build 2 projects (todolist, countdown timer)</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>Learn the basics. Yes JQuery is old, no one uses it, etc … . But there is a lot of codebase that still uses jQuery. What if you can find an online / freelancing job with jQuery that can make you an easy 100$ per hour. (speaking from experience). Learn the basics, know what it is, what it consists of.</p>
            <p>Take 1 week to learn and practice, then keep using sass in all your future projects. You will improve yourself over time.</p>
   
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <h3>3. Learn Bootstrap: (spend 2 weeks) : build 5 projects using bootstrap</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>CSS framework (also has javascript). Learn to read documentation. Very good skill to have that will help you in the long run. </p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Bootstrap will make prototyping easy for you. You can build prototypes of websites very fast, and then modify and optimize the websites for production.
                    Keep in mind, you use bootstrap for prototyping, but not for production. It’s too heavy for production. You will convert the code into css and js for production. Also there are lots of frameworks similar to Bootstrap, but they are all similar. Once you learn bootstrap, the other are similar.</p>
   
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <h3>4. Learn about APIs: (duration 2 weeks) :application programming interface</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>A way for you to communicate to the backend, get data and display data.
                    Build a couple of projects. (weather app, recipe app,...)</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Take longer if you need to, learning and knowing how to communicate with APIs will make you a better developer. </p>
            <p>Learn about Fetch and Axios for making requests.</p>
            <p>Once you build one or 2 projects, you will have a better understanding of APIs.</p>
   
        </div>

        <br><br>


        <h3>5. Gulp: (spend max 1 week): gulp is a build system that will increase you productivity</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> you don’t need to master it, you just need to know the basics and know how it works. </p>
   
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <h3>6. Webpack: (spend 1 week): module bundler</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>Know the basics. You don’t have to master it or learn from scratch.</p>
            <p>  Most of the time, you’ll just be adding few lines of code to an existing webpack config. Learn the basics and then move on. You can learn it in depth if required at a later stage in your career. (senior dev)</p>
   
        </div>

        <br><br>


        <h3>7. Learn basics of backend. (1 month)</h3>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>Again LEARN THE BASICS. A good frontend dev should have an idea how backend works.</p>
            <p>Start with the Theory. Know the basics, How front end communicate with backend, sending requests, getting responses back. </p>
            
            <p>Then learn FIREBASE.</p>
