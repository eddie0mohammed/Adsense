        <p>You’ve put in the hard work, you learnt all the technologies.</p>
        <h3>Note :</h3>
        <p>At this point, you should be comfortable with building anything as a front end developer.</p>
        <p>- You should be an expert at writing Html and CSS</p>
        <p>- You should be know javascript well and be able to solve most javascript coding problems.</p>
        <p>- You should know how to work with Apis.</p>
        <p>- You should know how to use firebase to deploy your site.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h2>NOW WHAT ?</h2>

        <h3>Time to start earning money. </h3>

        <p>Start low and slowly ramp up (don’t be greedy). It will take time to start earning a decent income as a side hustle. You should be patient.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>How do i start? Where do i start? </h3>
        <br>

        <p>1. Teaching</p>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>Usually this is the easiest and best option.</p>
            <p>You don’t need to be an expert to teach. For instance, You know Html and CSS. How hard can it be to teach Html to someone who doesn’t know anything and charge them $20 per hour for 5 hours a week. That’s an easy $100. Plus its a way for you to solidify what you already know. </p>
            
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <img src="./images/7/7.2.png" alt="featured image">

        <br><br><br>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Teaching will also help you improve your soft skills. You will improve yourself in a lot of ways, for instance, knowing how to express yourself clearly so that you are understood. That’s a huge plus.</p>

        <br>

        <p>2. Freelancing (Upwork)</p>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>Invest time in creating a professional profile. Your profile represents who you are. Don’t start applying for big jobs (for e.g building a whole website). Apply only for small simple jobs. E.g modify styles of existing website. Creating simple landing page for a product. You should basically look for jobs that you can complete in a couple of hours. </p>
                <br>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> You’ll start with bad clients, but don’t give up. You will win on the long term. There are no bad experiences. It’s all about learning.
            </p>
        
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <p>3. Contact people who you already know. (friends, neighbors)</p>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>E.g i had a friend who teaches english online. I contacted him and built him a landing page for himself and charged him 50$ for it. He invested 50$ in a landing page but in return he got a presence online that could land him more clients. That’s a good return on investment. Basically you have to be a good seller.</p>
                <br>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> While you are trying to start making money with what you learnt so far, you should also focus on phase 3 and keep learning and improving your skills as a web developer. Don't deviate from your initial goals.
