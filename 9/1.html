        <h2>Phase 4: Learning a Framework</h2>

        <p>Learning a framework will increase you chances of getting a job.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why not learn a Framework during phase 1: </h3>
        <p>You might think it would have been a good idea but it's not. You need have solid fundamentals and know how to build anything without a framework first.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Having weak fundamentals will only affect you career as a developer. That's why you should learn the old way of doing things first. Also, keep in mind, when you apply for a job, most of the time, the interviewer will question you on the fundamentals first. So, it's always good to have solid fundamentals.</p>
        <p></p>
        <br><br>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> While you start learning a framework, you should continue with the following in parallel.</p>
        <div class="list_container">
            <ul>
                <li><p>Continue making money on the side</p> </li>
                <li><p>Continue learning data structures and algorithms (30 mins a day)</p> </li>
                <li><p>Continue solving 1 coding challenge a day</p></li>
                
            </ul>
        </div>

        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Learning REACT</h2>

        <p>Why React?</p>
        <p>Simply because it's the framework that's mostly widely used at the moment. You want to learn a technology that is hot at the moment. Simple as that.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong>Keep in mind, the tech industry changes extremely fast. You need to be up to date with the latest technologies out there. That will increase your value as a developer.</p>

        <br><br><br>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Before learning react, you should learn NPM (Node packet manager). <br> Learn to use npm to install packages. Youâ€™ll need it for REACT.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h2>Where to start?</h2>

        <p>Below is a list of steps to follow to master React. Learn 1 at a time. Don't skip anything.</p>
        <div class="list_container">
            <p>1. Start with reading the <strong> whole</strong> documentation to get an overview of what react is and what it consists of.</p>
            <p>2. Learn React (create-react-app, installing packages, react-router-dom). Follow tutorials and code along. </p>
            <p>3. Learn about routing with <strong>React Router</strong></p>
            <p>4. Practice by building simple projects (todo list, countdown timer, rock paper scissors game, simple multi page app.</p>
            <p>5. After 5 projects with react and react router, learn <strong> Redux</strong>: A tool for state management. Don't get overwhelmed by people saying "redux is hard". It's not. It's just a matter of time till you get it. As soon as you understand how to use redux in your project, you'll see, it's simple.</p>
            <p>6. Rebuild the same 5 project you previously built with React, but this time using Redux. </p>
            <p>7. After completing 5 projects with React and Redux, learn about Context API. </p>
            <p>8. Build the same 5 projects with React and Context API (don't use Redux)</p>
            <p>9. Learn React Hooks. Thats the future of React.</p>
            <p>10. Again build the same 5 projects using React, React Hooks and Context API. (you'll see the superpower of React Hooks and Context API when used together) </p>

        <br><br>

       <p>At this point, you have learnt everything you need to get a job as a Frontend Developer.</p>
       <p>You've come a long way and you've learnt so much. You might have forgotten some of the things you learnt. Don't worry. You will learn them again as needed</p>
       <p>Keep in mind, at this point in time, learning is easy for you.</p>
