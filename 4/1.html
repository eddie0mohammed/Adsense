        <p>If you are a new cadet and you are asking yourself how much time will it take you before you get a job, then this article might be for you.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Most of us who came to 42, want a job as soon as possible. However, with the 42 curriculum, you are only learning to code in C. Search on google, how many jobs are there out there related to C and look at the requirements. Insane !!! </p>
        
        <br><br>

        <h2>Which path should I choose?</h2>

        <p>Well if you want to be able to start applying for jobs within the next 6 months, then you have to learn web development. Now the famous question : frontend or backend or fullstack.</p>
        

        <br><br>

       

        <h2>Why start with Frontend?</h2>

        <p>Well start with frontend. Why? Because it gives you the opportunity to make money while you are still learning. You can start making money in as little as 3 months after you start learning webdev. Itâ€™s not gonna be a huge amount of money, but an extra $100 per week can help you eat properly while at 42.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>But keep in mind, its gonna require hard work and consistent effort.</p>
