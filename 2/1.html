        <p>As mentioned in the previous article, there are some monthly requirements you need to meet to keep your dorms. If you fail to meet them, you might risk eviction. Here are a few tips that can help you meet the requirements: </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>1. Having a fixed schedule</h2>

        <p>You want to maximize your time learning, without being burnt out. The best way to do that is by having a fixed schedule. Go to the lab at the same time every day. Spend the same amount of time at the lab everyday (usually 10 hrs). Leave at the same time everyday. Make it a habit. You will benefit from it in the long run.
        </p>



        <br><br><br>

        <h2>2. Work in groups</h2>

        <p>When you first join as a Cadet, you are super motivated. You spend between 60 to 80 hrs per week coding at the lab. You knock out the first 2 projects within a month. And then you start chilling. You lose your motivation and you start slacking off. You start thinking you have no life, you do nothing else but code and all your motivation goes straight out of the window. Next thing you know you are registered to Check Your Dorms and you risk eviction. </p>

        <h2>3. Plan ahead of time</h2>
        <p>It helps when you have a very clear goal of what you are trying to achieve. One habit that I developed that proved to be beneficial is planning my work ahead of time. Everynight, before calling it a day at the lab and heading back to dorms, I would take 10 minutes to plan what I want to accomplish the next day. That gave me a clear goal and motivation for the next day. So the next day, when you go to the lab, you can immediately start being productive.</p>

        <h2>4. Monitor you progress</h2>

        <p>When you first join as a Cadet, you are super motivated. You spend between 60 to 80 hrs per week coding at the lab. You knock out the first 2 projects within a month. And then you start chilling. You lose your motivation and you start slacking off. You start thinking you have no life, you do nothing else but code and all your motivation goes straight out of the window. Next thing you know you are registered to Check Your Dorms and you risk eviction. </p>

        <h2>5. Don’t be influenced by the people around you</h2>

        <p>At 42, you will find a lot of people without a purpose. You will soon realize that there are a lot of “toxic” people around you. Especially in “Bocal”. Don’t let those people distract you from your goals. You have a purpose. Stick to you circle of friends and focus on your goals. 
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <p>Hopefully, these tips help you stay motivated and achieve your goals. Another thing that students at 42 struggle a lot with, while at 42, is living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
